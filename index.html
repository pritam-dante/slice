                        account via the slice app. This facility offers convenient access

                        Availing bank transfer service has a flat fee that is higher of
                        either 2.5% of the transaction amount or ₹25. The cardholder can
                        repay the borrowed amount either during the bill settlement cycle
                        of their slice super card or by making a prepayment before the
                        amount is billed.  <br /><br />
                        If the cardholder repays the full borrowed amount by the due date
                        as part of their next statement, no finance charges (or interest
                        charges) will apply to the transaction, offering an interest-free
                        borrowing option for short-term financial needs when repaid on
                        time. Otherwise, bank transfer advances attract finance charges at
                        the same rate as revolving credit, calculated from the date of
                        drawdown until full repayment. All fees, charges, and terms are
                        subject to change with 30 day prior notice, which will be
                        communicated through appropriate channels as stated in this MITC.

Currently, cardholders may choose between two repayment tenures — 2 months or 3 months.

This gives cardholders flexibility to spread out their spends without putting immediate strain on their monthly finances.</li>
