            <div class="subsection-content-description">
              We provide cardholders with the option to borrow funds directly
              from their available bank transfer limit into their savings bank
              account via the slice app. This facility offers convenient access
              to funds for various purposes.  <br /><br />
              Availing bank transfer service has a flat fee that is higher of
              either 2.5% of the transaction amount or ₹25. The cardholder can
              repay the borrowed amount either during the bill settlement cycle
              of their slice super card or by making a prepayment before the
              amount is billed.  <br /><br />
              If the cardholder repays the full borrowed amount by the due date
              as part of their next statement, no finance charges (or interest
              charges) will apply to the transaction, offering an interest-free
              borrowing option for short-term financial needs when repaid on
              time. Otherwise, bank transfer advances attract finance charges at
              the same rate as revolving credit, calculated from the date of
              drawdown until full repayment. All fees, charges, and terms are
              subject to change with 30 day prior notice, which will be
              communicated through appropriate channels as stated in this MITC. 
               <br /><br />
              The applicable charges and the due amount will be reflected in the
              respective month's bill/statement based on the chosen repayment
              option.

              slice reserves the right to impose specific service charges (or
              surcharge) on certain transaction categories of the credit card to
              promote responsible usage and cover service costs. These charges
              and fees, which may change from time to time, are payable by the
              cardholder for services provided by the bank or for any defaults
              related to the card holder's account. The bank also retains the
              right to modify, introduce, or adjust any charges or fees as
              necessary, with prior notice to the cardholders. <br /><br />
              For payments related to rent, education, online gaming, and wallet
              loading, a charge of 1% of the transaction amount or ₹10,
              whichever is higher applies. Fuel surcharges and railway ticket
              purchases attract a fee at 2% of the transaction amount or ₹10,
              whichever is higher, when cumulative spends in a billing cycle
              exceed ₹25,000. Utility payments are subject to a fee at 1% of the
              transaction amount or ₹10, whichever is higher, when cumulative
              spends in a billing cycle exceed ₹25,000.

            <div class="subsection-content-description">
                Finance charges, or interest charges, will be levied at the annual percentage rate on all transactions starting from the date of the purchase, if the cardholder has not paid the total outstanding amount in full. These charges will only apply for the number of days the amount remains overdue. These charges, if applicable, will be levied on the card holder's account until such outstanding balance is paid in full. 
                <br><br>
                If the cardholder carries forward any outstanding amount, including bank transfers, finance charges will be calculated using the end of day balance method and will apply to both carried-forward balances and new transactions. <br><br>
                 
                If the cardholder utilises the revolving credit facility of the slice super card and pays less than the total outstanding amount due on the monthly billing statement, finance charges will apply to the entire outstanding amount, excluding charges, and will also apply to any new transactions until the previous balance is fully repaid. 
                 <br><br>
                If the credit card account is written off due to non-payment, finance charges will continue to accrue until the total outstanding amount is fully paid.
